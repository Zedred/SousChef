# SousChef
Meal, macro, and grocery list planner

# Introduction
As a fitness enthusiast I understand that half the battle is in the kitchen. So to make meal planning easier, utilize my programming skills, and learn a few new things along the way, I've created this meal planning system.

# Summary
This meal planner is meant to perform the following tasks:
1. Retrieve recipes from online resources _or_ read csv summary files
2. Optimize the recipes for an individual's goals and specific physical profile using an IIFYM approach (If It Fits Your Macros)
3. Present a number of daily meal options that meet those specific goals
